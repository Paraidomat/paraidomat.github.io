## What is an ACI network?

- ACI is all about networking and how you deploy applications onto the network.
- ACI is really just a Spine/Leaf network of Nexus 9k switches with a 
  management platform.
- The management platform (APIC) provides you with a single place from which
  to manage the network
- ACI is an automated (VXLAN) overlay networking running over an automated
  (ISIS) underlay network.
- ACI can transport IP traffic including "Overlay" networks based on VXLAN, 
  NVGRE, etc.
- ACI networks allows organisations to offer automated network services 
  "on demand" thorugh an open REST API
- An ACI Network provides the underpinning for an automtaed internal private
  cloud through a _build and consume_ model of providing network services.
