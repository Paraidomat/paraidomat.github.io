### Examining Next-Generation Solutions for L2VPNs

#### L2VPN Technologies Envolution

4. MACinMAC 802.1ah
5. SPB 802.1aq
6. ECMP 302.1Qbp

##### WAN

1. VPLS
2. H-VPLS (PW Scale)
3. PBB-VPLS (MAC Scale)
4. EVPN (RFC 7432)
   - PBB-EVPN
   - EVPN-VxLAX
   - EVPN-IRB
   - EVPN-VPWS

###### VPLS Challenges

- no all-active per-flow redundancy
- looping traffic flooded from PE
- Duplicate frames from floods from the core
- MAC flip-flopping over PW (caused e.g. by Port-Channels)

### Introducing EVPN Basics

- BGP Control Plane
- Same principles as L3VPNs 
- No use of PWs

#### Benefits

- Integrated L2 and L3 services
- Efficiency (no flood and learn)
- flexible Multihoming (n-way redundancy)
- Control Plane and Data Plane Separation
  - Control Plane: EVPN (MP-BGP)
  - Data Plane:
    - MPLS (RFC7432)
    - PBB-MPLS (RFC7623)
    - Network Virtualization Overlay (NVO)
      (VXLAN, NVGRE, MPLSoGRE)

### Examining EVPN Terminology and Concepts

#### EVPN Concepts

- EVI (EVPN Instance) equivalent to VPNs / VRFs.
- Ethernet Segments 
  - Single Homed Devices
  - Multi Homed Devices
    - Redundancy / Load balancing
- BGP Routes
  | Number | Route Type |
  | ------ | ---------- |
  |      1 | Ethernet Auto-Discovery (AD) Route) |
  |      2 | MAC Advertisement Route |
  |      3 | Inclusive Multicas Route |
  |      4 | Ethernet Segment Route |
- BGP Route Attributes
  | Extended Communities |
  | -------------------- |
  | ESI MPLS Label       |
  | ES-Import (like RT)  |
  | MAC-Mobility         |
  | Default Gateway      |

#### EVPN Instance

> EVPN Instance (EVI) Identifies a VPN in the MPLS/IP Network

- VLAN-Based Service Interface
  - Single VLAN corresponds to a single bridge table (MAC forwarding table)
- Port-Based Service Interface
  - All VLANs on the port are part of the same bridge table
- VLAN Bundling Service Interface
  - Multiple VLANs share the same bridge table.
- VLAN-Aware Bundling Service Interface
  - EVI consists of multiple broadcast domains (VLANs), with each VLAN having its own bridge table.

#### Ethernet Tag-ID

- 32-bit field containing either a 12-bit (VLAN-ID) or 24-bit ID that identifies a broadcast domain **in** an EVI.
- EVI consists of one or more broadcast domains (VLANs)
- A given VLAN can be represented by multiple VLAN-IDs
  - PEs are responsible for transforming translation

#### Ethernet Segment

- Is a "site" connected to one or more PEs
- could be a single device (CE) or an entire network
- Uniquely identified by a 10 byte global ESI
- Multihomed site -> unique nonzero identifier
- Reserved ESIs:
  - all zero for single-homed sites
  - all one for MAX-ESI
- ESI should have nonreserved ESI, that is unique network wide
- There a 6 types of ESI
  | Type | Explanation |
  | ---- | ----------- |
  | 0x00 | Arbitrary value (operator-configured) |
  | 0x01 | Auto-generated by LACP |
  | 0x02 | Auto-generated by STP BPDU |
  | 0x03 | MAC-based ESI (auto-generated or operator-configured) |
  | 0x04 | Router-ID ESI (auto-generated or operator-configured) |
  | 0x05 | AS-based ESI (auto-generated or operator-configured) |
  
#### BEP EVPN Routes

- EVPN defines a new NLRI (AFI = 25, SAFI = 70)
- BGP capabilities advertisement is used to ensure that two speakers support EVPN
- EVPN NLRI
  | Size | Content |
  | ---- | ------- |
  | 1 byte | Route-Type (1-4) |
  | 1 byte | Length |
  | variable | Route Type-Specific |
- EVPN Route-Types
  | Type | Name |
  | ---- | ---- |
  |    1 | Ethernet Autodiscovery (A-D) Route |
  |    2 | MAC/IP Advertisement (ARP suppression) |
  |    3 | Inclusive Multicast Route |
  |    4 | Ethernet Segment Route (Designated Forwarder Election) |
  |    5 | IP Prefix Route |

> TODO: Add explanation for different Route-Types

### EVPN Multihoming and Suppression Mechanisms

- MHD ES autodiscovery
- MAC mass-withdraw
  - withdraw the reachability of a specific Ethernet Segment instead of hundreds of single MACs
- Split Horizon
  - Egress PEs use ESI Label to perform selective split-horizon filtering
- Aliasing
  - Use the ESI as abstaction layer.
  - Traffic is forwarded to an ESI which could be reachable via several PEs (active-active)
    - ESI -> PE mapping is using recursive lookup.
    - In case of single-active one PE will be designated forwarder, the other PE(s) will be standby
- Designated Forwarder (DF)
  - Similar to the concept of DF in multicasting
  - DF handles BUM (Broadcast, Unknown Unicast, Multicast) traffic.
  - DF is the one sending the traffic **towards** the ES
  - all routers are receiving traffic **from** the ES
  - DF is elected using modulo operation
    - VLAN mod N (N = Number of PEs for ESI)
    - All PEs join a ordered list (lowest IP first)
    - The modulos value defines which PE will take care of which VLAN. 
  - DF Filtering
  - DF Failover
- ARP broadcast suppression
  - Construct ARP caches on EVPN PEs, synchronize via BGP or data plane snooping
  - PEs act as ARP proxies for local hosts
- Unknown Unicast Suppression
  - prevent unkown unicast from going to the core using `unkown-unicast-suppress`
